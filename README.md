# Voxel Flight Simulator

A simple game developed for the purposes of both showcasing interesting features of sparse-voxel-octree raycasting and to utilize the Vulkan graphics API in a project.
Written in Rust, I decided to use the crate [Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) to access Vulkan API through a Rust-friendly wrapper. Original .NET version
written in F# is archived [here](https://github.com/ryco117/Voxel-Flight-Simulator-FSharp).
